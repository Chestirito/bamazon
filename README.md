# MySQL Bamazon
### bamazon (Challenge 2)

### Overview
#### Console app where users, depending on the file running, can simulate buying products, or modifying products for sale.

### Directions
* ### Running bamazonCustomer.js gives the user options to buy and view items on sale 
* ### Running bamazonManager.js gives the user options to view the database, view items with less than 5 in stock, restock products, and add new items
* ### Follow instructions on what to input

### Specifications
* ### Aside from inquirer and mysql npm packages, I also used easy-table to format and display the data coming from the database
* ### Inputs for id and quantities are validated, with id, the app checks with the database if the id exists
* ### On bamazonManager.js users can only choose existing departments, this is to avoid spelling mistakes
* ### Only finished up to challenge 2
